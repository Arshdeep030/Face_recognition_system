What is LBPH? 
Local Binary Pattern Histograms (LBPH) is an algorithm used for face recognition that examines the local texture around 
each pixel in the face image. It is widely used in computer vision for tasks such as face detection, face recognition, 
and emotion recognition due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and robust nature under varying lighting conditions.


what does bind does

`sqlite3` is a Python module that provides an interface to interact with SQLite databases. It allows you to create, 
query, and manipulate SQLite databases directly from Python code.

`from tkinter import *`: Imports all classes, functions, and constants from the `tkinter` module, which is used for creating GUI applications in Python.
`from tkinter import ttk`: Imports the `ttk` (Themed Tk) module, which provides modern, themed widgets like `Treeview`, `Combobox`, and `Progressbar`, offering enhanced styling compared to standard `tkinter` widgets.

import os` imports the **`os` module**, which provides functions to interact with the operating system. It enables tasks like file and directory manipulation, environment variable access, and executing system commands. 
Example:
- `os.listdir()` lists files in a directory.
- `os.mkdir()` creates a new directory.


Data Binding: These StringVar objects act as a bridge between Tkinter widgets (like Entry, Label, or OptionMenu) and Python variables, ensuring that changes in one are automatically reflected in the other.

conn.commit(): Saves the changes (inserts the new record) into the database.
self.fetch_data(): Likely updates the GUI to reflect the newly added data.
conn.close(): Closes the database connection to release resources.
